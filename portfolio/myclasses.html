                <h2>Databases</h2>
                <h3>Intro to Databases</h3>
                <p>I learned the basics of databases. I learned how they are structured, how they function, and how to extract data from them. I was introduced to databases through MySQL. This class helped me to know that I wanted to change my major to something computer related!</p>
                <h3>Database Design and Development</h3>
                <p>I learned more in depth about databases. I learned how to design my own databases and got a more extensive look at extracting data. For my final project I was able to create the basic structure of my own database based on Spotify.</p>

                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <h3>Intro to Programming</h3>
                <p>I learned the basics of the programming language, Python. I was able to implement these principles into several activities and projects including a wordle, mad-lib, and multi-choice story.</p>
                <h3>Programming With Functions</h3>
                <p>In this class, I got a closer look at Python, specifically with functions. I learned why functions in programming are so important and allow for more efficient code. For my final project in this class, I created a program that used a list of ancestors and would perform different activities based on what the user wanted.</p>
                <h3>Programming With Classes</h3>
                <p>I learned about the programming language C#. I learned the basics of how to use it and what to use it for. I also learned the difference between python and C# which is that python is an interpreted programming language and C# is a compiled language.</p>

                <h3>Web Fundamentals</h3>
                <p>In this class, I learned the basics of websites and how to create them from scratch. I was introduced to HTML and CSS. I created a white-water rafting site and this personal website, which helped me to learn new skills that are essential to website creation.</p>
                <h3>Dynamic Web Fundamentals</h3>
                <p>I continued to practice my skills with HTML and CSS and learned the basics of JavaScript. I also was taught how to ensure that the website functions well for different screen sizes. Each week I worked on projects that would help me to learn new skills involved in website creation.</p>
