      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This is an example of HTML code. HTML stands for hyper-text markup language. HTML is what gives a website its content and allows for the structure of the content. HTML is used in any website that you encounter on the web. The basic syntax used is &lt;example&gt; to open, and &lt;/example&gt; to close whatever element you are working on (header, footer, p, li, etc.) 
        This is an example of CSS code. CSS stands for cascading style sheets. CSS allows us to style a website by giving it color and size. We are able to determine where each element will be placed on the website. Without CSS our websites would look very strange!

      <h3>My Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Mission Statement - This is a website I created that was modeled exactly after the BYU-Idaho mission statement. I was given the content (title, subtitles, and paragraphs). Then I had to pick the font, colors, and layout by scratch. I had to structure the HTML in a way that would allow me to easily manipulate the content. Then I had to make the CSS to fit exactly how the original mission statement looked.
        Cool Pics - This is a website I created in one of my classes this semester. I also had to create this website from scratch but was given basic elements to work with. In this website I had the opportunity to practice media queries. This means that the structure of the elements of the website would change based on the size of the screen. I had to make sure that this website looked good and had functionality with each screen size (computer, tablet, and phone).

      <h3>My Classes</h3>
      <p>
        Databases
        Introduction to Databases
        I learned the basics of databases. I learned how they are structured, how they function, and how to extract data from them. I was introduced to databases through MySQL. This class helped me to know that I wanted to change my major to something computer related!
        Database Design and Development
        I learned more in depth about databases. I learned how to design my own databases and got a more extensive look at extracting data. For my final project I was able to create the basic structure of my own database based on Spotify. 
        Programming
        Introduction to Programming
        I learned the basics of the programming language, Python. I was able to implement these principles into several activities and projects including a wordle, mad-lib, and multi-choice story.
        Programming with functions
        In this class, I got a closer look at Python, specifically with functions. I learned why functions in programming are so important and allow for more efficient code. For my final project in this class, I created a program that used a list of ancestors and would perform different activities based on what the user wanted. 
        Programming with Classes 
        I learned about the programming language C#. I learned the basics of how to use it and what to use it for. I also learned the difference between python and C# which is that python is an interpreted programming language and C# is a compiled language.
        Websites
        Web Fundamentals
        In this class, I learned the basics of websites and how to create them from scratch. I was introduced to HTML and CSS. I created a white-water rafting site and this personal website, which helped me to learn new skills that are essential to website creation. 
        Dynamic Web Fundamentals
        I continued to practice my skills with HTML and CSS and learned the basics of JavaScript. I also was taught how to ensure that the website functions well for different screen sizes.  Each week I worked on projects that would help me to learn new skills involved in website creation.
