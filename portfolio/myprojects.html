            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>This is a website I created that was modeled exactly after the BYU-Idaho mission statement. I was given the content (title, subtitles, and paragraphs). Then I had to pick the font, colors, and layout by scratch. I had to structure the HTML in a way that would allow me to easily manipulate the content. Then I had to make the CSS to fit exactly how the original mission statement looked.</p>

            <h2>Cool Pics</h2>
            <p>This is a website I created in one of my classes this semester. I also had to create this website from scratch but was given basic elements to work with. In this website I had the opportunity to practice media queries. This means that the structure of the elements of the website would change based on the size of the screen. I had to make sure that this website looked good and had functionality with each screen size (computer, tablet, and phone).</p>
